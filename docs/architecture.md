# Architecture

How the system is layered, and — more usefully — where each rule is actually
enforced. When two layers seem to disagree, the database is the authority.

## The four layers

```text
  browser                        edge worker                   postgres
  ─────────────────────────      ─────────────────────────     ────────────────
  routes + pages + components    server functions              tables
  TanStack Query                 (*.functions.ts)              RLS policies
  supabase browser client   ──►  server-only logic       ──►   views
  (RLS as the signed-in user)    (*.server.ts)                 security-definer fns
                                                               triggers
```

There is no separate backend service. Anything that needs a secret, the
service role, or the ICF SOAP feed runs in a server function on the edge
worker. Anything that only needs the signed-in user's own permissions may run
in the browser directly against Supabase, because RLS is the boundary.

## Enforcement lives in the database

This is the single most important thing to understand before changing access
behaviour. The UI hides things; the database refuses them. Every rule below is
enforced in Postgres, and the TypeScript merely mirrors it for a better user
experience:

- **Roles.** Stored in `user_roles`, never on a profile row. Checked through
  the security-definer functions `private.has_role`, `private.is_editor` and
  `private.is_staff`, which RLS policies call. They live in the `private`
  schema, which PostgREST does not expose, so they are not callable as RPC
  endpoints — a signed-in user cannot probe another account's roles.
  Application code checks roles by reading `user_roles` through the caller's
  own client (`src/lib/authz.ts`). A user cannot grant themselves a role,
  because `user_roles` has no insert or update policy at all — role changes
  are service-role only.
- **Article access.** Editors and admins manage everything; contributors can
  read their own articles and may only insert, update or delete their **own
  drafts**. Anonymous visitors see published articles only. This is why the
  Insights CMS can safely operate through ordinary authenticated clients: a
  contributor physically cannot publish.
- **Directory eligibility.** A profile may only be `published` if its member is
  active _and_ holds a valid ACC/PCC/MCC credential. This is a trigger
  (`tg_directory_profile_eligibility_guard`), not a check in application code,
  so the sync engine, the member editor and staff tooling are all bound by it.
- **Integration safety.** `tg_integration_config_guard` makes TEST mode
  incapable of sending member email or opening account claiming, and makes the
  TEST→LIVE transition a one-way door. Setting the wrong flag raises an
  exception rather than quietly emailing 500 members.

If you need to relax one of these, change the policy or trigger. Do not add a
bypass in TypeScript.

## Server boundaries

Three ways to reach the server, chosen by who is calling:

**1. Server functions (`src/lib/*.functions.ts`)** — the default. Typed RPC
called from components via `useServerFn`, or from a loader. Protected ones
carry `.middleware([requireSupabaseAuth])`, which puts an authenticated
`supabase` client plus `userId` on `context`; queries through it run as the
user with RLS applied.

**2. Public server functions** — no middleware, therefore a public endpoint on
the published site. Used for reads that anonymous visitors legitimately make
(the coach directory, published Insights). These use a _publishable_ client
from `src/lib/supabase-public.server.ts`, never the admin client, so RLS still
constrains them.

**3. File routes under `src/routes/api/public/`** — raw HTTP for external
callers. Only one exists: `member-sync.ts`, the endpoint the nightly cron job
hits. This prefix bypasses site auth, so the handler verifies the caller
itself.

### The admin client

`supabaseAdmin` bypasses RLS entirely. It is used only where there is no
alternative — the ICF sync writing member rows, signing storage URLs for
anonymous visitors, and role-gated staff mutations. Two rules:

- Import it **inside** the handler (`await import(".../client.server")`), never
  at the module scope of a `*.functions.ts` file, because module scope of those
  files ships to the browser bundle.
- Authorize the caller _before_ reaching for it, and authorize through the
  user's own client. Never use the admin client to decide whether someone is an
  admin.

## Data flow: a public coach search

Worth tracing once, because it touches every layer and shows the view-first
pattern:

1. `src/routes/find-a-coach.tsx` renders `CoachDirectory`.
2. The component reads filters from the URL (they are shareable state) and
   calls `queryCoachDirectory`, a public server function.
3. That function queries `coach_directory_public` — a view, not the base
   tables. The view is the projection boundary: it exposes only safe columns
   and only reveals a member's email when they explicitly opted in.
4. Filtering, faceting and pagination happen in Postgres, not in JavaScript.
5. Profile images live in a **private** bucket, so the function mints
   short-lived signed URLs through `src/lib/storage.server.ts` before
   returning. This is the one place the admin client appears on a public path,
   and it is scoped to signing paths that the view already deemed public.

## Internationalisation

Locale is a path prefix, chosen for SEO: English is unprefixed, the other three
live under `/$locale`. Each public page has both an unprefixed route and a
`$locale` mirror; both render the same component from `src/pages`. Use
`<LocaleLink>` rather than `<Link>` in shared UI so links keep the visitor in
their language.

Interface copy lives in JSON dictionaries under `src/i18n`. Article content is
different: translations are rows in `article_translations`, keyed by locale,
with a `manually_edited` flag so an AI-generated draft is never allowed to
overwrite a human edit.

## Conventions worth following

- **Filename suffixes are load-bearing.** `*.server.ts` is blocked from client
  bundles by filename; `*.functions.ts` is the only sanctioned bridge.
- **Shared rules get one home.** Publish eligibility is
  `publishBlockReason` in `directory-eligibility.ts`; bucket names and URL
  lifetimes are in `storage.ts`. If you find yourself re-deriving one of these,
  import it instead.
- **URL as state.** Directory filters, mode tabs and pagination live in the
  query string so results are linkable and the back button behaves.
- **Never edit** `src/routeTree.gen.ts` or anything in
  `src/integrations/supabase/` — both are generated.

## Agent integrations (MCP)

The app exposes an MCP server at `/mcp` (`src/lib/mcp/`), so assistants such as
ChatGPT, Claude or Cursor can query the site. Access is OAuth 2.1: the client
registers dynamically with Supabase Auth, the user approves it on
`/.lovable/oauth/consent`, and every tool forwards that user's bearer token to
PostgREST — RLS decides what is visible, exactly as in the browser. No
service-role key is used.

Tools: `search_coaches`, `get_coach_profile` (published directory) and
`list_insights`, `get_insight` (published articles). Routes under `src/routes/mcp.ts`,
`src/routes/[.mcp]/…` and `src/routes/[.well-known]/…` are generated by
`mcpPlugin()` — never edit them by hand.
