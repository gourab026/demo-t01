# Operations and go-live

## The TEST / LIVE switch

The system's entire posture is one row in `integration_config`. It decides
which ICF feed the sync talks to, whether member email may be delivered, and
whether account claiming is open.

`tg_integration_config_guard` enforces three invariants in the database, so
they hold no matter which code path writes the row:

1. **TEST mode cannot send email or open claiming.** Both flags are forced off
   on write. Rehearsing against test data cannot spam real members.
2. **Claiming requires LIVE mode plus a recorded cutover.** Setting
   `account_claim_enabled` before `cutover_completed_at` exists raises an
   exception.
3. **LIVE → TEST is refused.** The cutover is a one-way door; reverting after
   real members hold accounts would be incoherent.

Treat these as the safety net that makes the rest of the runbook survivable —
not as something to work around.

## The nightly sync

A cron job (`icf-member-sync-daily`, 03:15 UTC) calls
`/api/public/member-sync`, which runs `member-sync.server.ts`:

The endpoint authenticates the caller with a dedicated token in the
`x-cron-token` header. The token lives in exactly two places: the
`MEMBER_SYNC_CRON_TOKEN` server env var, and `private.app_config` (key
`member_sync_cron_token`), which the cron job reads when it builds the request.
It is deliberately **not** the Supabase publishable key — that key is shipped to
every browser, so using it would let anyone on the internet trigger a full ICF
re-sync. To rotate: update the `private.app_config` row and the env var together.

1. Pull the member feed over SOAP from netFORUM xWeb.
2. **Feed sanity check.** If the record count has dropped by more than
   `feed_drop_threshold_pct` against the previous successful run, abort without
   writing. A truncated or failing feed would otherwise deactivate the entire
   membership in one pass — the check exists because that failure is silent and
   catastrophic.
3. Normalise each record and diff it against the stored row.
4. Create, update, or deactivate members; demote directory profiles that lost
   eligibility.
5. Write a `member_sync_runs` row plus per-event rows and per-member snapshots.

Everything is auditable after the fact. When member data looks wrong, start
with the most recent `member_sync_runs` row, then `member_sync_events` filtered
to that run, then `member_import_snapshots` for the specific member's
`changed_fields`.

A manual run can be triggered from `/integration`, which is also where the
rehearsal simulation lives — it reports what a cutover _would_ do without
writing.

### Lifecycle and deletion

Members who go inactive enter a grace period (`member_lifecycle_queue`) with a
scheduled deletion date rather than being removed immediately. Membership
lapses and renewals are routine; immediate deletion would destroy
member-authored profile content over an administrative gap.

## Go-live checklist

### Code — done

- [x] Sync engine, feed guard, audit trail
- [x] Directory eligibility rules enforced in the database
- [x] Member Area with self-service publishing
- [x] Public directory and coach detail pages on real data
- [x] Insights CMS with translations and scheduling
- [x] Claim flow, built end to end and gated off
- [x] Accessibility pass (WCAG 2.2 AA on public routes)

### Blocked on external configuration

- [ ] **Email domain.** Until one is configured, no member email can be
      delivered — which blocks the claim invitations, which blocks members
      getting into their profiles. This is the critical-path item.
- [ ] **Custom domain** for the public site.
- [ ] **LIVE ICF credentials** verified against the production feed.

### Cutover sequence

Do not reorder; each step depends on the previous one being verified.

1. Run the rehearsal simulation at `/integration` against LIVE credentials and
   review the projected create/update/deactivate counts. Numbers that look
   surprising are a stop signal.
2. Take an archive snapshot (`member_archive_snapshots`).
3. Flip `mode` to `live` and run a full sync.
4. Verify the directory: spot-check a sample of published coaches, and confirm
   the total count is plausible against ICF's own figure.
5. Record the cutover (`cutover_completed_at`). Only now does the database
   permit claiming to be opened.
6. Configure email delivery and send a small pilot batch of claim invitations
   before the full send.
7. Open `account_claim_enabled`.

### After go-live

- Watch `member_sync_runs` for the first several nightly runs.
- Watch `member_email_log` for failures during the invitation wave.
- Watch claim conversion; a low rate usually means invitations are landing in
  spam rather than that the flow is broken.

### Migration hygiene

- Do not reorder the migration history while the project is in TEST/cutover.
- Replaying the 46 existing migrations in order is correct, but many files are
  follow-up hardening passes on the same objects. If you need to understand the
  final RLS shape, read the last few migrations rather than the whole chain.
- Squashing the migration history into a single initial file is safe **only** for
  fresh environments. The current database already contains 501 test members and
  member-authored profiles, so any squash must be applied as metadata-only and
  verified against a throwaway copy. After go-live, the migrations can be squashed
  as a cleanup step; before go-live, keep them intact because they are the audit
  trail for the cutover rehearsal.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                 | Look at                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A coach is missing from the directory   | Their `member_directory_profiles.visibility`; if `hidden_*`, the reason is in the state name. Then check `credential_expires_on`, then that they have ≥1 region. |
| Sync aborted                            | `member_sync_runs.error_message`. An abort is usually the feed drop guard doing its job — check the feed before overriding.                                      |
| Member can't publish                    | `publishBlockReason` gives the exact cause; the editor already displays it.                                                                                      |
| Profile image not loading               | Signed URL expired, or the path was never signed. Check `storage.server.ts` and the TTLs in `storage.ts`.                                                        |
| Article visible in CMS but not publicly | Status is not `published`, or the locale has no `article_translations` row.                                                                                      |
