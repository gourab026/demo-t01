# Code map

A directory of where behaviour lives. Use this to find the owner of a feature
before adding a new file.

### Coach directory

| Module                     | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `directory.functions.ts`   | Public search RPC: filtering, faceting, pagination against `coach_directory_public`, plus signed image URLs.                                                       |
| `directory-eligibility.ts` | The single definition of who may appear publicly. `publishBlockReason` is the shared predicate used by the member editor, staff tooling and the server write path. |
| `coaches.ts`               | Client-safe directory types and display helpers.                                                                                                                   |
| `coach-finder-config.*`    | The coaching/mentoring/supervision mode configuration that drives the public mode tabs.                                                                            |

### Member data and the ICF pipeline

| Module                                       | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `member-sync.server.ts`                      | The import engine: pull the ICF feed, normalise, diff, create/update/deactivate, demote profiles that lost eligibility. The most operationally sensitive module in the project. |
| `icf-soap.server.ts`                         | SOAP/xWeb client for netFORUM. Credentials read inside handlers.                                                                                                                |
| `integration-config.server.ts`               | Loads the single `integration_config` row (TEST vs LIVE, email suppression, claim gate).                                                                                        |
| `member-profile.server.ts` / `.functions.ts` | Member self-service profile: validation, cleaning, the guarded publish path.                                                                                                    |
| `member-claim.server.ts`                     | Account claim token state machine — hashing, expiry, attempt limiting, single use.                                                                                              |
| `member-email.server.ts`                     | Email dispatch. Currently logs every intended send and delivers nothing; see operations doc.                                                                                    |
| `member-translations.*`                      | Per-locale coach profile content: translatable field list, derived states, AI translation and the member RPC surface. See `docs/member-translations.md`.                        |

### Insights CMS

| Module                      | Responsibility                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `articles.ts`               | Shared types (`ArticleRow`, `CategoryRow`, `ProfileRow`) and display helpers used by both the CMS and the public blog. |
| `articles.server.ts`        | Article reads, writes, status transitions and deletion.                                                                |
| `articles.functions.ts`     | The CMS RPC surface, with `assertStaff` guards.                                                                        |

### Shared infrastructure

| Module                      | Responsibility                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `storage.server.ts`         | `signStoragePaths` / `signProfileImages` — batch signing via the admin client.                         |
| `supabase-public.server.ts` | Anonymous client factory, including the `sb_`-key `apikey` header workaround.                          |

| `sitemap[.]xml.ts`                                                                                              | Generated sitemap across all four locales.                                                          |

## Database objects worth knowing

- **`coach_directory_public`** — the view every public directory read goes
  through. Change the projection here, not in application code. It is
  `security_invoker = on`, so the caller's own RLS still applies underneath.
- **`user_roles`** + `private.has_role` / `private.is_editor` /
  `private.is_staff` — the whole authorization model. The helpers sit in the
  non-exposed `private` schema; application code uses `src/lib/authz.ts`
  instead of calling them over RPC.
- **`coach_finder_config`** — one row. Display columns are readable by
  visitors; the internal tuning columns are restricted by **column-level**
  grants and read through `coach-finder-config.functions.ts` by staff.
- **`integration_config`** — one row, guarded by a trigger, controlling the
  TEST/LIVE posture.
- **`member_sync_runs`, `member_sync_events`, `member_import_snapshots`** — the
  audit trail for every sync. First place to look when member data looks wrong.
- **Buckets** `member-profile-images` and `article-images` — both private;
  access is always via signed URLs.
