/**
 * Staff/volunteer CMS gate.
 *
 * Entry requires a staff role (admin, editor or contributor). `editor` is an
 * additive grant: a claimed member who holds it passes this gate *and* keeps
 * the Member Area — the two are never mutually exclusive. `ssr: false` because
 * the Supabase session lives in localStorage, which the server cannot read.
 *
 * Roles come from the shared `["my-roles", userId]` query, so entering the
 * shell does not re-request what the components are about to read.
