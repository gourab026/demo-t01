/**
 * Staff-only read of the full Coach Finder settings row.
 *
 * The public site reads `coach_finder_config` directly with the publishable
 * key, but only the display columns are granted to `anon`/`authenticated`.
 * The internal tuning fields (feed drop threshold, snapshot retention, CSV
 * export cap) are therefore unreadable over the Data API and are served here
 * instead, behind an explicit staff role check.
 *
 * Writes are NOT routed through this function: the staff settings screen
 * updates the row with the caller's own client, where the "editors write"
 * RLS policy stays the enforcement boundary.
