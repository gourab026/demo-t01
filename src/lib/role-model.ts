/**
 * The single definition of the role vocabulary, shared by client code
 * (`roles.ts`), server-function guards (`authz.ts`) and — in spirit — the
 * `private.has_role / is_editor / is_staff` helpers in the database.
 *
 * Roles are ADDITIVE GRANTS, never a state machine. An account that holds both
 * `member` and `editor` is a member who can also work in the Insights CMS:
 * granting or revoking `editor` never touches `members.auth_user_id`, the
 * `member` grant, or Member Area access.
 *
 * `contributor` and `user` are dormant: their RLS policies still exist and are
 * still enforced, but nothing grants them and no UI surfaces them.
 *
 * Client-safe: no imports, no secrets, no I/O.
